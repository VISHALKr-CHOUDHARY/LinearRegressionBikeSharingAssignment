## General Information
The project uses the bike sharing data set to prepare a model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. Company is BoomBikes one of the US bike-sharing provider. They recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. o, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They are planning this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Conclusions
Major Driving factor which can be used to predict demand of bikes on year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer and winter.

## Technologies Used
Python Libraries are Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, MatplotLib, sklearn, statsmodels and Plotly
